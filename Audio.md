### Sound
produced by vibrations of objects

- Waveform
- frequency = pitch
- amplitude = loudness
#### Analog Digital Conversion
- sample rate = 44,100 Hz
- Bit depth = 16 bits/ channel
  
# Fourier Transform
- Decompose complex periodic sound into sum of sine waves oscillating at different frequencies
- we can now understand how different frequencies contribute to the original wave
